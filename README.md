#  Danger Zone Detection - Prototype

This is a basic prototype built using **YOLOv5**, **OpenCV**, and **PyTorch** to detect construction workers entering predefined **danger zones** on-site using real-time camera input. The system identifies people and checks if they are inside a marked danger area using simple bounding box logic and alerts visually.
